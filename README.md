Proxy Design Pattern

I have chosen to use the Proxy Design Pattern because it is a way to control and manage the access to the object 
that needs to be protected, in other words, hides the original object and controls the access to it. 
On this case, the access to the database. By doing it, it assures best security since the ProxyConnection Class
operates as an intermediate between the clients and the database.  

Factory Design Pattern

The Factory Design Pattern was chosen due to fact that encapsulates the creation of the objects in one class,
making the process of troubleshooting and the validation of the ENUM continent more convenient. Also, I am more familiar with the 
Factory Design implementation, so I wanted to practise it.
